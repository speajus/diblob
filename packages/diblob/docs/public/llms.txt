# diblob

> A dependency injection framework for TypeScript/JavaScript where the proxy (blob) is the key. Pass around the blob, and it acts like the interface you assign to it.

Important notes:

- **The blob IS the key**: Unlike traditional DI frameworks that use separate tokens/symbols, diblob uses the proxy itself as both the identifier and the interface
- **Automatic dependency resolution**: Dependencies are automatically inspected and resolved when registering blobs
- **Reactive dependencies**: When a blob is re-registered, all dependents automatically update with the new implementation
- **Constructor injection**: Blobs work as default parameters in constructors, enabling automatic dependency detection
- **File organization**: Production applications should separate interfaces/blobs, implementations, and registration into distinct files
